# Plum-Island-Outbreak-Game-React (In Progress)

A react.js based resource game where you are the director of the famous Plum Island animal research facility where
dangerous viruses are researched on a budget. Funding is tight in this government agency run by the US department of agriculture.
It is your mission to try to keep the place running for as long as possible, researching ever more dangerous viruses in the hopes
that they provide you with more grant money and increased biohazard authorizations to research ever more exotic viruses like Foot-and-mouth
disease, West-Nile virus, Viral Hemorrhagic Fever, and Lyme disease.

Beware though, there is always a chance for outbreak. With the islands location in the Long Island Sound, it is right in the middle 
of a hurricane corridor. Power can go out, protocols may not be followed, the air system can fail.

As your research developes, so does available technology for combating an outbreak. Below is a comprehensive list of your concerns as
director of the island research laboratory. locked items are locked at the start of the game and do not contribute to your budget
nor do they reduce any biohazardous outbreaks from happening. Locked concerns are unlocked as you progress through the tech research
tree and the biohazard level of the facility that has been achieved.

on each turn, your budget, research progression, and outbreak possibility will replenish accordingly on factores as discussed below.

## Air System
provides an innovative negative air pressure through out the facility that ensures airborne vectors are contained within the facility.
### airSystem: not locked
general air systems such as duct work and ventilations.
### gaskets: not locked
sealants around doors and vents that prevent penetrations through the enclosure of the facility.
### airPressure: not locked
air pressure control systems that maintain negaive air pressure of the enclosed facility to the outside. Especially in hot zones.
### filters: locked
air filtration systems that provide an additional measure against airborne vectors in the case of an incident.
### generatorFeeds: locked
provides additional backup power in the case of a loss of main power to the air pressure system. loss of the negative air pressure system would be catastrophic.

## Biologicals
All aspects of biologicals being researched. research tree progression included.
### biologicals: not locked
The heart of the laboratory, the biologicals represent the actual viruses being studied by the lab.
### researchTree: not locked
The research tree that will provide unlocks for all types of concerns to achieve new equipment, facilities, and sr research staff
### biologicalProperties: not locked
aspects of biologicals that regard its virulence, vector, type, zoonoses, strain, as well as human and animal lethality
### outbreakProgression: not locked
in the instance of an outbreak, its progression can be tracked here. Once the progression reaches a certain point and escapes to mainland, the game will have been lost.

## Budget
the main resource of the game to maintain the facilities research activites
### budget: not locked
funds available for purchasing equipment, hiring new scientists, building facilities etc...
### grants: not locked
surplus funding provided to perform research based on success of scientific staff.
### accounting: not locked
staff which can reduce the salaries of other staff
### salaries: not locked
funds which are depleted every end of turn to pay for the salaries of all the employees
### kickbacks: not locked
### embezzlement: not locked
