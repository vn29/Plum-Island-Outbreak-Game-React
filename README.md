# Plum-Island-Outbreak-Game-React (In Progress)

A react.js based resource game where you are the director of the famous Plum Island animal research facility where
dangerous viruses are researched on a budget. Funding is tight in this government agency run by the US department of agriculture.
It is your mission to try to keep the place running for as long as possible, researching ever more dangerous viruses in the hopes
that they provide you with more grant money and increased biohazard authorizations to research ever more exotic viruses like Foot-and-mouth
disease, West-Nile virus, Viral Hemorrhagic Fever, and Lyme disease.

Beware though, there is always a chance for outbreak. With the islands location in the Long Island Sound, it is right in the middle 
of a hurricane corridor. Power can go out, protocols may not be followed, the air system can fail.

As your research developes, so does available technology for combating an outbreak. Below is a comprehensive list of your concerns as
director of the island research laboratory. locked items are locked at the start of the game and do not contribute to your budget
nor do they reduce any biohazardous outbreaks from happening. Locked concerns are unlocked as you progress through the tech research
tree and the biohazard level of the facility that has been achieved.

on each turn, your budget, research progression, and outbreak possibility will replenish accordingly on factores as discussed below.

## Air System
provides an innovative negative air pressure through out the facility that ensures airborne vectors are contained within the facility.
### airSystem: not locked
general air systems such as duct work and ventilations.
### gaskets: not locked
sealants around doors and vents that prevent penetrations through the enclosure of the facility.
### airPressure: not locked
air pressure control systems that maintain negaive air pressure of the enclosed facility to the outside. Especially in hot zones.
### filters: locked
air filtration systems that provide an additional measure against airborne vectors in the case of an incident.
### generatorFeeds: locked
provides additional backup power in the case of a loss of main power to the air pressure system. loss of the negative air pressure system would be catastrophic.

## Biologicals
All aspects of biologicals being researched. research tree progression included.
### biologicals: not locked
The heart of the laboratory, the biologicals represent the actual viruses being studied by the lab.
### researchTree: not locked
The research tree that will provide unlocks for all types of concerns to achieve new equipment, facilities, and sr research staff
### biologicalProperties: not locked
aspects of biologicals that regard its virulence, vector, type, zoonoses, strain, as well as human and animal lethality
### outbreakProgression: not locked
in the instance of an outbreak, its progression can be tracked here. Once the progression reaches a certain point and escapes to mainland, the game will have been lost.

## Budget
the main resource of the game to maintain the facilities research activites
### budget: not locked
funds available for purchasing equipment, hiring new scientists, building facilities etc...
### grants: not locked
surplus funding provided to perform research based on success of scientific staff.
### accounting: not locked
staff which can reduce the salaries of other staff
### salaries: not locked
funds which are depleted every end of turn to pay for the salaries of all the employees
### kickbacks: not locked
risky sources of funding at the possible costs of looking essential equipments or facilities due to neglect
### embezzlement: not locked
direct access to cash with the possibility of fines and penalties if caught. Hiring more accountants will make this more difficult to get away with.

## Decontamination
measure to reduce and prevent an outbreak.
### decontamination: not locked
funds directed towards decontamination will reduce the possiblities for the initial origin of an outbreak from within the lab
### suits: locked
suits provide an extra measure to maintain the health of the staff granted the virus is not resistant to this form of decontamination
### showers: locked
reduces viruses progression during an outbreak granted the virus is not resistant to this form of decontamination
### protocols: not locked
reduces outbreak progression granted there is not a breach of protocol event.

## Electricity
required resource to maintain essential research equipment and biohazard safety.
### electricity: not locked
the main resource with the number representing the likelyhood of a power outage. A power outage during an outbreak situation can be dangerous and lapse many safety measures in place.
### freezers: not locked
increase research efficiency and provide a safegaurd against uncontrolled growth of a biological culture.
### boilers: locked
power hungry and very important to the appropriate decontamination of waste water from the facility. required for more advanced forms of research.
### backupGenerators: locked
provide reduced risks of a loss of power occuring
### aboveGroundLines: locked
provide reduced risks of a loss of power occuring
### belowGroundLines: not locked
provide reduced risks of a loss of power occuring. not vulnerable to storms.

## Employees
the staff of Plum Island
### employees : not locked
total number of employees
### scientists : not locked
number of scientists of staff
### jrScientists : not locked
number of jr scientists of staff
### srScientists : locked
number of sr scientists of staff. locked at beginning of game and must be hired. provide significant research advancement.
### facilitiesEngineering : not locked
number of facilities engineering staff that provide decontamination and preventative measures.
### administration : not locked
increases the efficiency of all other employees

## Equipment
esential research equipment used by scientists to increase their research productivity. is dependent on power
### equipment: not locked
provides a status indicator of the efficiency of current equipment
### centrifuges: not locked
increases research efficiency. dependent on power.
### freezers: locked
increases research efficiency. dependent on power.
### hotPlates: locked
increases research efficiency. dependent on power. requires jr scientists on staff
### tickColonies: locked
increases research efficiency. dependent on power. requires sr scientists on staff
### incubators: locked
increases research efficiency. dependent on power. requires scientists on staff
### pipettes: not locked
increases resarch efficiency

## Facilities
provide neccesary workspaces and area for decontamination
### facilities: not locked
provides a status indicator of the efficiency of current facilities
### storage: locked
provides research efficiency and improved decontamination to prevent progression of an outbreak
### safetyShowers: locked
improves safety against a biological outbreak. required for some biohazard levels
### workbenches: not locked
provides improved research efficiency
