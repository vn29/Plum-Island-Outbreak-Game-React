# Plum-Island-Outbreak-Game-React (In Progress)

A react.js based resource game where you are the director of the famous Plum Island animal research facility where
dangerous viruses are researched on a budget. Funding is tight in this government agency run by the US department of agriculture.
It is your mission to try to keep the place running for as long as possible, researching ever more dangerous viruses in the hopes
that they provide you with more grant money and increased biohazard authorizations to research ever more exotic viruses like Foot-and-mouth
disease, West-Nile virus, Viral Hemorrhagic Fever, and Lyme disease.

Beware though, there is always a chance for outbreak. With the islands location in the Long Island Sound, it is right in the middle 
of a hurricane corridor. Power can go out, protocols may not be followed, the air system can fail.

As your research developes, so does available technology for combating an outbreak. Below is a comprehensive list of your concerns as
director of the island research laboratory. locked items are locked at the start of the game and do not contribute to your budget
nor do they reduce any biohazardous outbreaks from happening. Locked concerns are unlocked as you progress through the tech research
tree and the biohazard level of the facility that has been achieved.
